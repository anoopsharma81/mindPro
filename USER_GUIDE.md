## 🧠 Creating Reflections

### The What/So What/Now What Framework

**1. What happened?**
- Describe the situation objectively
- Focus on your experience, not clinical details
- Use "a patient" or age ranges (e.g., "patient in their 60s")

**2. So what? (Analysis)**
- What did you learn?
- Why was this significant?
- What surprised or challenged you?

**3. Now what? (Action)**
- What will you do differently?
- What changes to your practice?
- What further learning do you need?

### Select GMC Domains
Choose which GMC Good Medical Practice domains your reflection addresses:
- **Domain 1**: Knowledge, Skills and Performance
- **Domain 2**: Safety and Quality
- **Domain 3**: Communication, Partnership and Teamwork
- **Domain 4**: Maintaining Trust

You can select multiple domains per reflection.

### ⚠️ Patient Confidentiality
**DO NOT include**:
- Patient names or identifiers
- NHS numbers or hospital numbers
- Dates of birth
- Addresses or contact details
- Specific ward/bed locations

**Metanoia will warn you** if it detects potential patient information!

✅ **DO use**:
- "A patient" or "the patient"
- Age ranges (e.g., "in their 50s")
- Generic descriptions
- Your learning and actions
