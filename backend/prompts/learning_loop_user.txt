Create a Learning Loop reflection based on the following clinical experience.

Use the Metanoia Learning Loop framework v1.1 to structure this reflection for deliberate practice and metacognitive improvement.

## Clinical Experience

{{clinical_text}}

## Instructions

Analyze this clinical experience and create a structured Learning Loop reflection that:

1. **Gate**: Assess the emotional and attentional state during this experience
   - How focused was the doctor?
   - What was the emotional tone of the situation?
   - How intense were the emotions?

2. **Observation & Action**: Extract key observations and the clinical action taken
   - What were the most important clinical observations?
   - What decision or action was taken?

3. **Encoding**: Identify the clinical pattern and connections
   - What clinical pattern or principle does this represent?
   - How does this connect to prior medical knowledge?
   - What tags would help retrieve this learning?

4. **Prediction**: Determine what was predicted
   - What hypothesis or prediction was made?
   - How confident was the clinician?
   - What key features were expected?

5. **Feedback**: Compare prediction to outcome
   - What was the actual outcome?
   - What was the error signal (difference between prediction and reality)?

6. **Reflection on Bias**: Identify cognitive biases
   - What cognitive biases might have been present?
   - How can these biases be countered in future?

7. **Update Rule**: Create actionable learning
   - What if-then rule captures this learning?
   - What micro-practice can be done in 48 hours?
   - When should this learning be reviewed? (2, 7, 30, 90 days)

## Output Format

Respond ONLY with valid JSON following the Metanoia Learning Loop v1.1 schema.

Include all required fields:
- gate (with attention_0_3, emotion_valence_-3_+3, emotion_arousal_0_3, context_note)
- observation_action (with observations array and action)
- encoding (with pattern_name, links_prior_knowledge, chunk_tags)
- prediction (with hypothesis, probability_pct, discriminators_expected, confidence_bucket)
- feedback (with outcome, error_signal)
- reflection_bias (with bias_tags, counter_moves)
- update_rule (with if_then, micro_rep_48h, spaced_plan_days)

Optional meta section can include:
- case_id
- timestamp_iso
- author
- domain (clinical, business, research, other)

Remember to respect all character limits and validation rules specified in the schema.
