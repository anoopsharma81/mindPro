**Subject**: Invitation: Pilot Test Metanoia - NHS Appraisal Assistant

---

Dear [Colleague Name],

I'm excited to invite you to pilot test **Metanoia**, a new mobile app I've developed to help NHS clinicians prepare for their annual appraisals.

## What is Metanoia?

Metanoia transforms the often-stressful appraisal process into a continuous, meaningful practice of reflection. Instead of scrambling at year-end, you can:

✅ **Capture reflections** throughout the year using the What/So What/Now What framework
✅ **Track CPD activities** with automatic hour totals and GMC domain mapping
✅ **Generate MAG-ready exports** in seconds for your appraiser
✅ **Stay safe** with built-in patient confidentiality checks
✅ **Work anywhere** - iOS, Android, and web, with offline support

## Why Pilot Test?

As a pilot user, you'll:
- Get **early access** to a tool that could save you hours each year
- **Shape the product** - your feedback will directly influence development
- **Join a community** of forward-thinking NHS clinicians
- **Get free access** throughout the pilot (and beyond!)

## Getting Started

1. **Download the app**: [Link to TestFlight/APK]
2. **Watch the 3-min demo**: [Link to demo video]
3. **Read the Quick Start**: [Attach QUICK_START.md]
4. **Start using it** - aim for 1-2 reflections in the first week

## What I Need From You

- **Use it regularly** - try to add at least one reflection per week
- **Share feedback** - what works, what doesn't, what's missing?
- **Report issues** - any bugs, crashes, or confusing features
- **Complete a short survey** after 2 weeks and 1 month

**Time commitment**: 5-10 minutes/week + 10 minutes for surveys

## Your Data is Safe

Metanoia is built with NHS Information Governance compliance from day one:
- ✅ UK/EU data storage
- ✅ End-to-end encryption
- ✅ Patient confidentiality checks
- ✅ GDPR compliant
- ✅ You own your data - export or delete anytime

See the full privacy policy in the app.

## Next Steps

**Interested?** Reply to this email or let me know by [date], and I'll send you:
1. Download link (TestFlight for iOS or APK for Android)
2. Quick start guide
3. Demo video
4. My direct contact for support

**Questions?** I'm happy to jump on a quick call to walk you through it.

## Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Onboarding and initial use
- **Week 3-4**: Regular use and feedback collection
- **Week 5-6**: Iteration based on feedback
- **Week 7+**: Continue using + expand pilot

I'm looking for **5-10 pilot users** to start, so this is an exclusive opportunity!

## Why I Built This

Like many of us, I found the annual appraisal process stressful and last-minute. I wanted a tool that made reflective practice continuous, meaningful, and aligned with how we actually work.

Metanoia is my attempt to solve that problem - and I hope it helps you too.
